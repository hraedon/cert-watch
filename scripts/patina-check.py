"""check_patina.py -- the patina conformance gate (Plan 005).

Verifies that a consuming tool's vendored patina assets have not drifted and
that the tool's own CSS honours the token contract. Stdlib only; every family
tool is Python. Vendored into consumers by sync.sh as patina-check.py.

Checks:
  0. self stamp     -- a vendored copy carries a `# patina:sha256 <hash>` line
                       directly under the shebang; the gate hashes itself and
                       refuses to run if its own bytes were edited. Running
                       from a patina checkout (unstamped) is fine and noted.
  1. tokens block   -- css/tokens.css must carry EXACTLY ONE
                       /* patina:begin <rev> sha256:<hash> */ ... /* patina:end */
                       pair, in that order, whose bytes hash to the stamp.
                       Consumers may append CSS below the end marker -- that
                       tail is checked like any other tool CSS (checks 3+4).
  2. theme.js stamp -- first line // patina:sha256 <hash> must match the rest
                       of the file's bytes.
  3. token contract -- every var(--x) referenced in tool CSS must be defined
                       by the contract block or by the tool itself; the tool
                       must not redefine a contract token; with --prefix, all
                       tool-defined tokens must carry --<prefix>-.
  4. colour ratchet -- raw colour literals (#hex / rgb / hsl / oklch) in tool
                       CSS are fingerprinted against a committed baseline.
                       A NEW fingerprint fails even if the total is unchanged,
                       so a violation cannot be swapped for another one.
                       Removing one always passes. A line may be exempted with
                       `patina-allow: <reason>`; the reason is mandatory and
                       the number of exemptions is itself ratcheted. Size (px)
                       ratcheting was considered and deliberately deferred:
                       patterns.md itself specifies px paddings, so a px
                       ratchet is all noise today.
  5. dead classes   -- a <prefix>- class named in markup with no rule in any
                       tool CSS renders as an unstyled div, and no other check
                       here notices. Ratcheted like colour literals, because
                       every consumer starts with a backlog and a wall of
                       failures on day one is how a gate gets switched off.
                       Template-computed names (class="{{ ... }}") are skipped
                       rather than guessed at.

What check 1 does and does not prove:

  Without --upstream, the block hash is compared against a stamp stored in the
  same file. That proves INTEGRITY (nothing mangled the block after vendoring)
  and nothing else: anyone who edits a token value can recompute the stamp. To
  check actual DRIFT, pass --upstream <patina-checkout> (a git checkout).

  --upstream keeps two conditions apart, because conflating them makes a
  vendored standard behave like a coupled one:
    DRIFT (fails)  the block does not match patina AT THE REV IT IS STAMPED
                   WITH -- edited and re-stamped, or that history is gone.
    UPGRADE (note) patina has advanced past that rev. Adopting it is a
                   deliberate consumer change with a reviewable diff. A newer
                   upstream is never a conformance failure.

Usage:
  check_patina.py <static-dir> [--tokens css/tokens.css] [--theme theme.js]
                  [--no-theme] [--prefix cw] [--extra <dir>]...
                  [--upstream <patina-checkout>]
                  [--ratchet-file <path>] [--update-ratchet] [--report]

Exit: 0 clean (or --report), 1 on any failure, 2 on usage error.
