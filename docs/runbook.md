# cert-watch Operator Runbook

Everything you need to deploy, upgrade, back up, restore, and troubleshoot cert-watch in a single-file reference.

---

## Deploy

### Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

Data persists in the `cert-watch-data` volume (mounted at `/var/lib/cert-watch` inside the container). The SQLite database is at `/var/lib/cert-watch/cert-watch.sqlite3`.

### Kubernetes (Argo CD)

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy/argocd/application.yaml
```

Argo CD watches `deploy/k8s/` and syncs automatically. CI builds and pushes a multi-arch image to GHCR on every merge to `main`, then commits the new tag to `deploy/k8s/kustomization.yaml`.

### Direct Kubernetes apply

```bash
kubectl apply -k deploy/k8s
```

### Linux + systemd

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-linux.sh
```

Installs to `/opt/cert-watch`, enables `cert-watch.service`. See `deploy/systemd/cert-watch.service`.

### First run (no auth)

cert-watch is **secure by default** — it never serves anonymously on a network
by accident. With no auth configured, behaviour depends on whether the instance
is *network-exposed*:

| Situation | Behaviour |
|-----------|-----------|
| Bare loopback (`127.0.0.1`, no proxy) | Serves open, redirects to `/setup` to create an admin |
| Routable bind (`0.0.0.0`) **or** loopback + `CERT_WATCH_TRUST_PROXY=1` (IIS/nginx) | **Auto-provisions** a local `admin` with a generated password and comes up authenticated |
| Any bind + `CERT_WATCH_ALLOW_UNAUTH=1` | Serves open (explicit opt-out; dev / air-gapped only) |

When it auto-provisions, the one-time password is written to
`${CERT_WATCH_DATA_DIR}/initial-admin-password` (mode 0600) and logged (check
`docker logs` / `journalctl -u cert-watch` / `kubectl logs`). **For production,
don't rely on the generated credential** — configure `AUTH_PROVIDER` (LDAP/OAuth)
or pin a password via `CERT_WATCH_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`
(hash with `cert-watch hash-password`), then delete the password file.

> If auto-provisioning can't persist the admin (e.g. the data dir isn't
> writable), a network-exposed instance **fails closed** — it refuses to serve
> open rather than expose itself unauthenticated.

---

## Upgrade

cert-watch uses forward-only schema migrations. On startup, the app automatically:

1. Checks the `schema_version` table for applied migrations.
2. Creates a timestamped pre-migration backup: `cert-watch-pre-migration-<timestamp>.sqlite3` in the data directory.
3. Applies any pending migrations.
4. Records each migration in `schema_version`.

**Upgrade procedure (Docker):**

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hraedon/cert-watch:latest
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

The new binary applies migrations on first boot. The pre-migration backup is kept automatically.

**Upgrade procedure (Kubernetes):**

Merge to `main`. CI handles the image build and kustomize tag bump. Argo CD syncs within a minute. The pod restarts with the new image and applies any pending migrations.

**Verify migration status:**

```bash
sqlite3 /var/lib/cert-watch/cert-watch.sqlite3 "SELECT * FROM schema_version ORDER BY id;"
```

---

## Backup and Restore

### Backup

The `cert-watch backup` command creates a WAL-safe copy using `VACUUM INTO`, which works while the app is running:

```bash
cert-watch backup /path/to/backup.sqlite3
```

In Docker:

```bash
docker exec cert-watch cert-watch backup /var/lib/cert-watch/backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).sqlite3
```

Automated pre-migration backups are also created on every upgrade (see Upgrade section).

### Restore

1. **Stop cert-watch.**

   ```bash
   # Docker
   docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose.yml down

   # Kubernetes (scale to 0)
   kubectl scale deployment cert-watch --replicas=0

   # systemd
   sudo systemctl stop cert-watch
   ```

2. **Replace the database file.**

   ```bash
   cp /path/to/backup.sqlite3 /var/lib/cert-watch/cert-watch.sqlite3
   ```

3. **Start cert-watch.**

   The app detects the `schema_version` table and skips already-applied migrations. If restoring into a newer binary, pending migrations run automatically with a fresh pre-migration backup.

**Important:** cert-watch uses a single-writer model with `Recreate` rollout strategy in Kubernetes. Only one instance writes to the database at a time. Do not run multiple instances pointing to the same SQLite file.

---

## Troubleshooting Scans

### A scan is failing

**1. Check the logs.** With `CERT_WATCH_LOG_FORMAT=json`, each log line is structured JSON:

```bash
docker logs cert-watch 2>&1 | grep '"message".*scan'
```

Key fields: `timestamp`, `level`, `message`, and any `extra` context.

With text logs (default):

```bash
docker logs cert-watch 2>&1 | grep scan
```

**2. Common scan failures:**

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `connection refused` | Target not listening on 443 | Verify the host and port |
| `connection timed out` | Firewall / network unreachable | Check network path |
| `certificate verify failed` | Self-signed or expired target cert | Expected for internal certs; cert-watch extracts the cert regardless |
| `private IP rejected` | `CERT_WATCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=0` | Set to `1` if scanning internal hosts |
| `hostname resolution failed` | DNS can't resolve the host | Set `CERT_WATCH_DNS_SERVERS` for custom DNS |

**3. Scan retry behavior.** `scan_host()` retries transient failures (connection refused, timeout) up to 2 times with exponential backoff. Check logs for retry attempts.

**4. Private IP scanning.** Controlled by `CERT_WATCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS` (default: `1` — enabled). When set to `0`, RFC 1918 and ULA addresses are rejected. Loopback, link-local, and the cloud metadata endpoint (`169.254.169.254`) are always blocked regardless of this setting.

**4a. Scan allowlist (recommended for sensitive sites).** `CERT_WATCH_ALLOWED_SUBNETS` takes a comma-separated CIDR list (e.g. `10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16`). When set, a private target is allowed only if it falls inside one of those ranges — everything else private is refused, making internal scanning an explicit, auditable capability. Public hosts remain scannable. The first-run setup wizard prompts for these ranges; you can change them later via the env var. For defence-in-depth, also restrict egress at the network layer (the shipped `deploy/k8s/networkpolicy.yaml` is permissive toward internal ranges by default — tighten it to your approved targets).

**5. Custom DNS.** Set `CERT_WATCH_DNS_SERVERS` to a comma-separated list of DNS server IPs (e.g., `10.0.0.1,10.0.0.2`) for resolving internal hostnames. Queries are sent via UDP port 53 for A/AAAA records. Falls back to system resolver if custom DNS returns no results.

### Secret file convention

Any credential variable supports a `_FILE` variant (standard Docker/Kubernetes secret mount pattern). For example:

- `LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/ldap_bind_pw` — reads the file contents as the password
- `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/oauth_secret`
- `LDAP_CA_CERT_FILE=/run/secrets/ldap_ca.pem` — PEM CA certificate for LDAPS

If both `$NAME` and `$NAME_FILE` are set, `$NAME` takes precedence.

---

## Authentication and Authorization

### LDAP / Active Directory

```bash
AUTH_PROVIDER=ldap
LDAP_SERVER=ldap://dc1.example.com,ldap://dc2.example.com
LDAP_BASE_DN=DC=example,DC=com
LDAP_BIND_DN=CN=cert-watch-svc,OU=ServiceAccounts,DC=example,DC=com
LDAP_BIND_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/ldap_bind_pw
LDAP_CA_CERT_FILE=/run/secrets/ldap_ca.pem
LDAP_REQUIRED_GROUPS=CN=CertWatchOps,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com
LDAP_CONNECT_TIMEOUT=3
```

- Comma-separated `LDAP_SERVER` enables DC failover (tries each server in order).
- `LDAP_CA_CERT` is required for `ldaps://` — cert-watch validates the server cert against this CA. Without it, LDAPS connections will succeed but log a warning about unverified certificates.
- `LDAP_REQUIRED_GROUPS` uses AD's transitive group membership check (`LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN` OID 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1941) — nested group membership counts.

### OAuth / Microsoft Entra ID

```bash
AUTH_PROVIDER=entra
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<app-registration-id>
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE=/run/secrets/oauth_secret
OAUTH_ISSUER_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0
```

### Local break-glass admin

For when the primary IdP (LDAP/OAuth) is unavailable:

```bash
cert-watch hash-password
# Enter password, get scrypt hash
CERT_WATCH_LOCAL_ADMIN_USER=admin
CERT_WATCH_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=scrypt$16384$8$1$<salt>$<hash>
```

- Disabled unless both `CERT_WATCH_LOCAL_ADMIN_USER` and `CERT_WATCH_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` are set.
- Evaluates before the primary provider — works even when LDAP/OAuth is down.
- Bypasses the group/role gate (implicit admin).
- Every login emits a WARNING log and an audit row with `break_glass=true`.
- **Rotate the password after each use.**

### Authorization gate

When `CERT_WATCH_ALLOWED_GROUPS` or `CERT_WATCH_ALLOWED_ROLES` is set, a user must belong to at least one listed group or role. Without these settings, any authenticated user has access.

---

## Secure Deployment Profile

For production, use these settings:

```bash
AUTH_PROVIDER=ldap              # or entra
CERT_WATCH_LOG_FORMAT=json      # structured logs for SIEM
CERT_WATCH_AUTH_SECRET=<stable-key>  # persist sessions across restarts
CERT_WATCH_ALLOWED_SUBNETS=10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16  # only scan approved internal ranges
CERT_WATCH_COOKIE_SECURE=1      # HTTPS-only cookies (default)

# Behind a reverse proxy / IIS that terminates TLS:
CERT_WATCH_TRUST_PROXY=1                          # client IP from forwarded headers
# CERT_WATCH_TRUSTED_PROXIES=10.0.0.5             # restrict who may set them
CERT_WATCH_BASE_URL=https://certs.example.com     # correct OAuth redirect URI
```

Scope `CERT_WATCH_ALLOWED_SUBNETS` to exactly the internal networks you intend
to monitor (or use `CERT_WATCH_ALLOW_PRIVATE_IPS=0` to block all private
scanning). Pair it with a network-layer egress restriction for defence in depth.

Ensure `CERT_WATCH_AUTH_SECRET` is set to a stable value. Without it, a random key is generated on every restart, invalidating all active sessions.

---

## Unauthenticated Paths

The following paths are open even when auth is enabled:

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/healthz` | Liveness probe |
| `/metrics` | Prometheus metrics |
| `/static/*` | CSS, JS, images |
| `/login` | Login form |
| `/auth/callback` | OAuth callback |
| `/auth/logout` | Logout |

All other paths (dashboard, scan history, alerts, host management) require authentication. The `/api/*` data routes return `401` for unauthenticated requests.

### `/metrics` exposure decision

The `/metrics` endpoint is intentionally left unauthenticated for compatibility with standard Prometheus scraping. It exposes aggregate counts (certificate totals, scan counts) but not hostnames, certificate details, or any identifying information.

**Recommendation:** Restrict `/metrics` at the ingress level (network policy, IP allowlist) so only your Prometheus scraper can reach it. If a security review requires auth on metrics, set `CERT_WATCH_METRICS_TOKEN=<token>` — the endpoint then requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (point your scraper's `bearer_token` at the same value). No reverse-proxy shim needed.

---

## Scale Ceiling

cert-watch uses a **single-writer SQLite database** with WAL mode enabled. This is a deliberate tradeoff: zero-ops database management in exchange for a single-instance deployment model.

### Expected capacity

| Metric | Comfortable ceiling |
|--------|---------------------|
| Tracked hosts | ~5,000 |
| Certificates (total, including chain) | ~50,000 |
| Scan history rows | ~200,000 |
| Concurrent users | ~20 (web UI is not a high-throughput API) |

WAL mode allows concurrent reads while a write is in progress. Daily scans are serialized by the scheduler. API reads are fast due to SQLite's in-process architecture.

### When to revisit (BC-031 trigger)

Consider PostgreSQL or MSSQL when any of these become true:

1. **Fleet size exceeds 5,000 hosts** — scan cycle takes longer than the scheduling window.
2. **High-availability requirement** — multiple cert-watch instances need concurrent write access.
3. **Multi-writer need** — more than one process must write to the database simultaneously.
4. **Compliance mandate** — organizational policy requires a managed database service.

The database layer is abstracted into a repository pattern (`database/` package with `schema.py`, `repo.py`, `queries.py`, `connection.py`). Adding a PostgreSQL backend is a matter of implementing the same repository interfaces — see BC-031.

## CLI Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cert-watch` | Start web server |
| `cert-watch backup <path>` | Create WAL-safe database backup |
| `cert-watch hash-password` | Generate scrypt hash for `CERT_WATCH_LOCAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` |
| `cert-watch re-encrypt <old_key>` | Re-encrypt kv_store secrets after `.auth_secret` rotation |

---

## Key Rotation and Recovery

cert-watch encrypts sensitive kv_store values (LDAP bind passwords, OAuth client secrets, SMTP passwords) using a Fernet key derived from the persisted `.auth_secret` file. If `.auth_secret` is accidentally deleted or regenerated, these values become undecryptable.

**Startup warning:** If the app detects encrypted values it cannot decrypt, it logs a warning listing the affected keys and suggests running `cert-watch re-encrypt`.

**Recovery procedure after `.auth_secret` rotation:**

1. Stop cert-watch.
2. Restore the old `.auth_secret` value (or set `CERT_WATCH_AUTH_SECRET` to the old key).
3. Run `cert-watch re-encrypt <old_key>` — this decrypts values with the old key and re-encrypts them under the current key.
4. Start cert-watch.

The `<old_key>` argument is the raw signing key string (the hex value from the old `.auth_secret` file or the old `CERT_WATCH_AUTH_SECRET` env var).
