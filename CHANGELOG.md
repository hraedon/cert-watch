# Changelog

All notable changes to cert-watch are documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- **Insights page** — expiration calendar plus TLS-version and posture-grade fleet trends
- **Discover page** — CT-based coverage reconciliation and private-CA inventory
- **Dashboard redesign** — chip-based filters, fingerprint grouping, SQL-paginated queries
- **Detail page** — per-certificate panel cards with chain visualization, drift history, posture breakdown
- **In-UI password rotation** — change local admin password from Settings (BC-102)
- **CSP nonces** — per-request `script-src` nonce; all inline `on*=` handlers converted to delegated listeners (BC-075)
- **Session revocation** — HMAC session tokens embed per-user version; logout/credential-change invalidates prior sessions (BC-081)
- **Secure-by-default auth** — network-exposed instances auto-provision a local admin on first run (BC-083)
- **Read-only / read-write role tier** — `CERT_WATCH_WRITE_USERS` gates mutation access (BC-086)
- **Scan allowlist** — `CERT_WATCH_ALLOWED_SUBNETS` CIDR list scopes which private ranges are scannable (BC-080)
- **Async scanner** — `scan_host_async()` / `store_scanned_async()` for non-blocking concurrent scans
- **Reusable retry policy** — `retry.backoff_range()` exponential/linear strategy
- **CLI subcommands** — `cert-watch backup`, `cert-watch hash-password`, `cert-watch re-encrypt`
- **Prometheus metrics** — `/metrics` endpoint with optional bearer-token gating
- **CT monitor** — periodic Certificate Transparency reconciliation
- **Bulk CSV import** — `/hosts/import` for adding many hosts at once
- **Alert groups** — group-based routing for alert recipients
- **Audit log** — append-only mutation/login record with configurable retention
- **E2E test suite** — Playwright-based auth, settings, dashboard, upload, and delete flows

### Changed
- Dashboard queries are now SQL-paginated (Plan 018 B2) — no more `sqlite3.Row` leaks into routes
- Auth module decomposed from `auth.py` monolith into `auth/` package (Plan 021)
- `SecurityContext` is an immutable dataclass on `app.state.security`; `create_app()` injects dependencies (Plan 018 B1)
- CSP `style-src` keeps `'unsafe-inline'` (inline `style=` custom properties)
- CSRF is double-submit cookie; token accepted via header/form only, never query string (BC-070)
- `CERT_WATCH_COOKIE_SECURE` defaults to `1`; set `0` only for plain-HTTP local dev

### Fixed
- BC-101: monthly trend chart bucketing with dynamic bar scaling
- BC-090: entrypoint normalizes `--host`/env so BC-083 check sees the real bind
- BC-084: A+ posture for non-443 ports
- BC-087/88/89: audit findings (credential sanitization, error messages)
- BC-071: OAuth ID-token verification fails rather than silently falling back to userinfo
- BC-073: OAuth nonce verification in ID-token claims
- BC-074: `create_app` factory pattern for test isolation
- Scheduler loop bug that could cause missed daily scans
- SMTP password leakage in error messages

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-26

### Added
- PKCS#12 (`.pfx`/`.p12`) and PKCS#7 (`.p7b`/`.p7c`) upload support
- TLS posture grading (A+/A/B/C/F) with configurable checks
- Drift detection alerts (issuer change, key-size drop, SHA-1 downgrade, TLS/posture downgrade)
- Certificate history snapshots with configurable retention
- Renewal tracking (links renewed certs to predecessors)
- Per-host threshold overrides for alert timing
- CAA record lookup endpoint
- HSTS probe during scans
- Fleet posture lenses (by issuer, owner, renewal method)
- Tags for certificates and hosts
- KV store for persistent settings with encrypted secret storage
- Database migration framework (0001–0011)
- LDAP/AD authentication with STARTTLS and group membership checks
- OAuth/OIDC authentication (Microsoft Entra, Google) with JWKS-based ID-token verification
- Break-glass local admin with scrypt hashing
- Rate limiting (SQLite-backed, proxy-aware)
- Setup wizard for first-run configuration
- Settings page (Auth, SMTP, Alerts tabs)
- Systemd unit with security hardening
- Windows/IIS deployment support (HttpPlatformHandler + ARR reverse proxy)
- Docker Compose deployment
- Kubernetes manifests with Argo CD GitOps
- Multi-arch Docker image (amd64 + arm64)
